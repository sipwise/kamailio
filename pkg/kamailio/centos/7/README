The following modules are not included in CentOS 7 builds because they have
dependencies that cannot be met by the base or EPEL CentOS YUM repos or are
obsolete.

Obsolete modules
----------------
* dialog_ng		use the ims_dialog module instead

Modules with unmet dependencies
-------------------------------
Note: If you need any of these modules you will need to find (and possibly
      build) and install the dependencies and then do a manual build of
      Kamailio.

Ordered by module name:
* app_java requires libgcj
