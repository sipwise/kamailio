RFC2307: An Approach for Using LDAP as a Network Information Service

  This document is experimental and based on RFC2251, which has been obsoleted
  by RFC 4510, RFC 4511, RFC 4513, RFC 4512 and updated by RFC 3377 and RFC
  3771.  Anyhow, AFAIK RFC 2307 is not obsoleted.

RFC2256: A summary of the X.500(96) user Schema for use with LDAPv3

  This rfc contains a collection of attribute types and object classes
  collected from various ITU documents. Attribute types such as objectClass or
  cn are defined here.

  This document has been obsoleted by RFC 4510 and updated by RFC 4512, RFC
  4517 and RFC 4519.


RFC2587: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure LDAPv2 Schema

  This document has been obsoleted by RFC 4523.


RFC1274: The COSINE and Internet X.500 Schema

  This document has been obsoleted by RFC 4524.

RFC2798: Definition of the inetOrgPerson LDAP Object Class

RFC4514: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation
        of Distinguished Names

RFC4515: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation
         of Search Filters

RFC4530: LDAP entryUUID Operational Attribute

  This RFC defines the entryUUID operational attribute which can be used by
  the server to assign unique identifiers to objects in the directory. Such
  identifiers can be used to identify the object even when the dn of the
  object changes. Unfortunately the entryUUID attribute cannot by modified by
  the user and thus it is not directly usable for us.

RFC2252 LDAPv3: Attribute Syntax Definitions

  This document has been obsoleted by RFC 4510, RFC 4517, RFC 4523, RFC 4512
  and updated by RFC 3377
