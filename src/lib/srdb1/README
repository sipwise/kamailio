This directory contains the generic database support interface - db1. The interface 
should be used by all modules willing to communicate with a database. Kamailio
can then switch from one database to another simply by loading a different 
database support module. Directory example contains a very simple example 
how to use the interface. Directory doc contains the API documentation.
