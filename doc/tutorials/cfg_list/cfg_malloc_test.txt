Configuration Variables for malloc_test
=======================================

                  [ this file is autogenerated, do not edit ]


 1. malloc_test.check_content
        check if allocated memory was overwritten by filling it with a
        special pattern and checking it on free..
        Default: 0.
        Range: 0 - 1.
        Type: integer.

 2. malloc_test.realloc_p
        realloc probability in percents. During tests and mem_rnd_alloc
        realloc_p percents of the allocations will be made by
        realloc'ing and existing chunk. The maximum value is limited to
        90, to avoid very long mem_rnd_alloc runs (a realloc might also
        free memory)..
        Default: 0.
        Range: 0 - 90.
        Type: integer.
