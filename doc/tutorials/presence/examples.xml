<para>This section is under construction...

<para>I found a bug during testing sample configs - one TM module change caused
impossibility of sending request to predefined destination. As far as I know
affected modules are presence_b2b and msilo.
</para>

<section><title>Full presence server</title>
<para>This config file has grown from previous versions of presence server
configurations. It has to be re-tested with Ottendorf and de-uglyfied. (TBD soon)

<section><title>Presence server with no authorization and without RLS</title>
<para>Following config file is based on demo config file installed with SIP-router
It is not finished yet. I recommend to use a variant of the config file above right
now.</para>

<section><title>Forwarding to presence server</title>
<para>It is good idea to have separated presence stuff from the proxy. You can
use following piece of code for that. Instead of
<function>t_forward_nonack</function> you can use
<function>t_forward_nonack_tcp</function>.
</para>
